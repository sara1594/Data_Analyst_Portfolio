# Data Analyst Portfolio

## About
Hi, I am Sachie, a junior analyst. The following are the part of my data journeys, and I’d like to share my skills in data analytics. Since I jumped into data analytics, I've been enjoying being around data. With the power of data analytics, I am hoping to be a part of people who help make the world a better place.

## My Projects

### Project 1. [Student Alcohol Consumption](https://github.com/sara1594/Data_Analyst_Portfolio/tree/main/My_Projects/Student%20Alcohol%20Consumption)
**Code :** [`Student_list_4.sql`](https://github.com/sara1594/Data_Analyst_Portfolio/blob/5d1d53091035875e09f7bf4ce8f7b966b6a60820/My_Projects/Student%20Alcohol%20Consumption/Student_list_4.sql),
[`alcohol_consumption.Rmd`]()   

**Background :** 
I found an interesting dataset, "Student Alcohol Consumption", which is about secondary school students and their alcohol consumption. Drinking is a very common habit for many people. It brings us a lot of fun, but sometimes causes serious problems in our lives. Thus I thought it would be wonderful if I could bring my insights about correct understanding of alcohol espceially to young people through my case study of this dataset.

**The goal of this project is to answer this question ;**
- Does alcohol consumption relate to students’ school performance, and if it does, what can they do for their goals?

**Technologies and Libraries :**    
R, SQL, Microsoft Excel

**Processes :**
1) Collect data from kaggle 
2) Data screening with Microsoft Excel
3) Data cleaning and manipulation with SQL
4) Data analysis and Data visualization with R

### Project 2. [Annual Wage Comparison U.S. vs Japan](https://github.com/sara1594/Data_Analyst_Portfolio/tree/main/My_Projects/Annual%20Wage%20Comparison%20U.S.%20vs%20Japan)
**Code :** [`Job_Comparison.sql`](https://github.com/sara1594/Data_Analyst_Portfolio/blob/f93ab91018bb79e83d023e0718e198035da2a2f2/My_Projects/Annual%20Wage%20Comparison%20U.S.%20vs%20Japan/Job_Comparison.sql),
[`jobs_from_bls.gov.ipynb`](https://github.com/sara1594/Data_Analyst_Portfolio/blob/f93ab91018bb79e83d023e0718e198035da2a2f2/My_Projects/Annual%20Wage%20Comparison%20U.S.%20vs%20Japan/jobs_from_bls.gov.ipynb)   

**Background :** 
Interestingly, both U.S. and Japan are at the same level on the national annual median wages (in 2020), but it doesn't mean their work envrionments are the same. This time, I was curious comparing two countries, especially in wages of each career and educational background. New findings from the analysis might be useful for people who are looking for a career in each country.

**The goal of this project is to answer these questions ;**
- Do educational backgrounds affect earnings? If yes, how?
- Do the wages on the same professions differ between two countries? If yes, how?

**Technologies and Libraries :**    
Python, SQL, Tableau, Microsoft Excel

**Processes :**
1) Collect data with web scraping (https://www.bls.gov/ooh/) with Python
2) Data screening with Microsoft Excel
3) Data cleaning and manipulation with SQL
4) Data analysis and Data visualization with Tableau

### Project 3. [Missing Persons and Racial Disparity in Media](https://github.com/sara1594/Data_Analyst_Portfolio/tree/main/My_Projects/Missing%20Persons%20and%20Racial%20Disparity%20in%20Media)
  
**Background :**
Every life matters, but bias and indifferene cause the disparities of human life. Racial disparity in Media is "White Syndrome". Although some reasonings can be used for the explanations of this matter, the fact from data will make us think twice that the chance of saving people's lives should be equal. 

**The goal of this project is to answer these questions ;** 
- Who is actually missing?
- How does 'White Syndrome' affect on media coverage of missing persons?

**Technologies and Libraries :**    
Tableau, Microsoft Excel

**Processes :**
1) Extract data from reliable source (NCIC website)
2) Clean and organize data with Microsoft Excel
3) Visualize data with Tableau

**Code :** [`fit_data_analysis.Rmd`](https://github.com/sara1594/Data_Analyst_Portfolio/blob/94b3eefe433b33e5f1631935ffca1e9c8faed628/My_Study_Projects/How%20Can%20a%20Wellness%20Technology%20Company%20Play%20It%20Smart%3F/fit_data_analysis.Rmd)   
**Senario :**   
You are a junior data analyst working on the marketing analyst team at Bellabeat, a high-tech manufacturer of health-focused products for women. Bellabeat is a successful small company, but they have the potential to become a larger player in the global smart device market. Urška Sršen, cofounder and Chief Creative Officer of Bellabeat, believes that analyzing smart device fitness data could help unlock new growth opportunities for the company. You have been asked to focus on one of Bellabeat’s products and analyze smart device data to gain insight into how consumers are using their smart devices. The insights you discover will then help guide marketing strategy for the company. You will present your analysis to the Bellabeat executive team along with your high-level recommendations for Bellabeat’s marketing strategy. (referred from Google Data Analytics Course)

**The goal of this project is to answer these questions ;** 
- What are the desirable features for Bellabeat considering the current wearable device trend?
- What feature can we add for better self-management?

### Project 2. US Population with Tableau
**Tableau Public :** [`US States Population`](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/sachie.tran/viz/USStatesPopulation_16334518073820/Dashboard1)
**Code :** [`Job_Comparison.sql`](https://github.com/sara1594/Data_Analyst_Portfolio/blob/e1bf165968548251c62d9bfe65fe9f85bc1704b5/My_Study_Projects/US%20Population%20with%20Tableau/Job_Comparison.sql) 
**Background :**  
Hex tile maps are sometimes an effective way to comprehend data. Tableau enables us to create those simplified maps, so I wanted to try it myself. This time, I used diamond shape instead of hex shape. There are many useful resources on the Internet for creating a hex-tile map, but I mainly followed [How to use hex-tile maps to eliminate the Alaska effect](https://www.tableau.com/about/blog/2017/1/viz-whiz-hex-tile-maps-64713). It is not a very complicated process, so this method will be in my tool box of data visualization.
