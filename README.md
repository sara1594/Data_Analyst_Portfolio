# Data Analyst Portfolio

## About
Hi, I am Sachie, a junior analyst. The following are the part of my data journeys, and I’d like to share my skills in data analytics. Since I jumped into data analytics, I have been enjoying being around data. With the power of data analytics, I am hoping to be a part of people who help make the world better place.

## My Projects

### Project 1. [Student Alcohol Consumption](https://github.com/sara1594/Data_Analyst_Portfolio/tree/main/My_Projects/Student%20Alcohol%20Consumption)
**Code :** [`Student_list-3.sql`](https://github.com/sara1594/Data_Analyst_Portfolio/blob/b4995307911ca67ad2d8dba3dd5683a7ae8cc3fd/My_Projects/Student%20Alcohol%20Consumption/Student_list_3.sql),
[`alcohol_consumption.Rmd`]()   

**Background :** 
I found an interesting dataset, alcohol consumption of secondary school students. 

**The goal of this project is to answer these questions ;**
- Does alcohol consumption affect students’ health, how?
- Does alcohol consumption relate to students’ school outcome, how?

**Technologies and Libraries :** 
R, SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS), Microsoft Excel

**Processes :**
1) Collect data from kaggle 
2) Data screening with Microsoft Excel
3) Data cleaning and manipulation with SQL
4) Data analysis and Data visualization with R


### Project 2. [Annual Wage Comparison U.S. vs Japan](https://github.com/sara1594/Data_Analyst_Portfolio/tree/main/My_Projects/Annual%20Wage%20Comparison%20U.S.%20vs%20Japan)
**Code :** [`Job_Comparison.sql`](https://github.com/sara1594/Data_Analyst_Portfolio/blob/f93ab91018bb79e83d023e0718e198035da2a2f2/My_Projects/Annual%20Wage%20Comparison%20U.S.%20vs%20Japan/Job_Comparison.sql),
[`jobs_from_bls.gov.ipynb`](https://github.com/sara1594/Data_Analyst_Portfolio/blob/f93ab91018bb79e83d023e0718e198035da2a2f2/My_Projects/Annual%20Wage%20Comparison%20U.S.%20vs%20Japan/jobs_from_bls.gov.ipynb)   

**Background :** 
The U.S. and Japan, their national annual median wages are at the same level. But by going to the details, the unique features on each country's work situations can be found. This time, I'd like to focus on each job's educational background and its median payment.

**The goal of this project is to answer these questions ;**
- Do educational backgrounds affect earnings? If yes, how?
- Do the wages on the same professions differ between two countries? If yes, how?

**Technologies and Libraries :** 
Python, SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS), Tableau, Microsoft Excel

**Processes :**
1) Collect data from web scraping (https://www.bls.gov/ooh/) with Python
2) Data screening with Microsoft Excel
3) Data cleaning and manipulation with SQL
4) Data analysis and Data visualization with Tableau

### Project 2. [Missing Persons and Racial Disparity in Media](https://github.com/sara1594/Data_Analyst_Portfolio/tree/main/My_Projects/Missing%20Persons%20and%20Racial%20Disparity%20in%20Media)
  
**Background :**
Every life matters, but bias and indifferene cause the disparity of human life. Racial disparity in Media is 'White Syndrome'. Although some reasonings can be used for the explanations of this matter, the fact from data will make us think twice of the equal chance of saving people's lives. 

**The goal of this project is to answer these questions ;** 
- Who is actually missing?
- How does 'White Syndrome' affect on media coverage of missing persons?

**Technologies and Libraries :** 
Tableau

**Processes :**
1) Extract data from reliable source (NCIC website)
2) Clean and organize data with Microsoft Excel
3) Visualize the data wit Tableau

### Project 2. US Population with Tableau
**Tableau Public :** [`US States Population`](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/sachie.tran/viz/USStatesPopulation_16334518073820/Dashboard1)   
**Background :**  
Hex-tile map is a simple but effective way to display U.S. by states. This time, I used diamond shape instead of hex shape.
There are many useful resources on the Internet for creating a hex-tile map, but I mainly followed [How to use hex-tile maps to eliminate the Alaska effect](https://www.tableau.com/about/blog/2017/1/viz-whiz-hex-tile-maps-64713). It is not very complicagted process, so this method will be in my tool box for visualization.
