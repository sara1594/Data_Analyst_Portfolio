[`jobs_from_bls.gov.ipynb`](https://github.com/sara1594/Data_Analyst_Portfolio/blob/f93ab91018bb79e83d023e0718e198035da2a2f2/My_Projects/Annual%20Wage%20Comparison%20U.S.%20vs%20Japan/jobs_from_bls.gov.ipynb)   
**Project Description:**  
**Background :** 
The U.S. and Japan, their national annual median wages are at the same level. But by going to the details, the unique features on each country's work situations can be found. This time, I'd like to focus on each job's educational background and its median payment.

**The goal of this project is to answer these questions;**
- Do educational backgrounds affect earnings? If yes, how?
- Do the wages on the same professions differ between two countries? If yes, how?

**Technologies and Libraries :** 
Python, SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS), Tableau, Microsoft Excel

**Processes :**
1) Collect data from web scraping (https://www.bls.gov/ooh/) with Python
2) Data screening with Microsoft Excel
3) Data cleaning and manipulation with SQL
4) Data analysis and Data visualization with Tableau

**Project Description:**  
**Background :**
Every life matters, but bias and indifferene cause the disparity of human life. Racial disparity in Media is 'White Syndrome'. Although some reasonings can be used for the explanations of this matter, the fact from data will make us think twice of the equal chance of saving people's lives.
