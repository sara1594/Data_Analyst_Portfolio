### Project 1. Annual Wage Comparison U.S. vs Japan

By comparing the occupational data between Japan and U.S., I'd like to find the answers for my questions;
- Does an educational background affect earnings? If yes, how?
- Do the wages on the same professions differ between two countries? If yes, how?

My answers and the visualizations are in my Tableau page
