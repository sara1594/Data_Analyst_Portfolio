### Project 2. Missing Persons and Racial Disparity in Media

The goal of this project is to find the answers for my questions;
- What does missing persons data show us?
- How does 'White Syndrome' affect on media coverage of missing persons?

My answers and the visualizations are in my Tableau page:    
[`Missing Persons and Racial Disparity in Media`](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/sachie.tran/viz/MissingPersonsandRacialDisparityinMedia/Dashboard1#1)
